            <h2>Cat Care Instructions and Tips</h2>
            <p>If you're considering bringing home a new cat, please make adoption your first option. We encourage you to browse our <a href="BrowsePets.html" >directory of adoptable cats</a> in your area.</p>
            <p>
                <h3>Feeding</h3>
                <ul id="dogFeed">
                    <li>Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.</li>
                    <li>You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your catâ€™s water bowls daily.</li>
                    <li>Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.</li>
                    <li>Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well  Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.</li>
                    <li>Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat.</p>
            <p>
                <h3>Grooming</h3>
                Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.
